# Clock-Recognition-By-Image-Processing

This program has a dataset which contains 15 photos of every numeral , and by processing them (Crop all of them and resize them into a same dimension) 
provides one average picture of each numeral and adjust its colors. Then every numeral of the input digital clock photo (which is in black and white) 
will be cropped and resize and compare with average photos which was produced from the dataset ,and recognize that figure. After recognition an analog clock 
will start to work from that time.

Besides above function this program can resize every photos and also it can crop multiple photos which are in table form and have white(RGB: 255, 255, 255) background. 


Note:"Photos must be in bmp format and smaller than 2000 pixels - Clock photos must be in black and white(There are 3 test photos in the directory)"
